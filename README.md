# CrookedText

Draw crooked text in SwiftUI.

## TODO
 - [x] Move to separate files
 - [ ] Create SPM
 - [ ] Logo for header in readme
 - [ ] Support text along path shapes instead of only circle (https://talk.objc.io/episodes/S01E165-animating-along-paths).
 - [ ] Create README (show what isn't supported inside, but easy to use, like rotationEffect)
 - [ ] Test animation (kerning, replace text, radius)
 - [ ] Test accessibility
 - [ ] Support hit target
